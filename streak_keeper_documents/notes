Now I know why I'm going to make, how to realize that (listed functions), not
what do I do? At what point, or what should I be prepared before I actually
start coding?

-things that comes to mind
    a. algorithm design
    b. data structure design
    c. visualize how the function will be used by the users

++notes
- remember, other users are likely not to have the same cli 
  (font, display size, etc.)

- haven't thought a lot, but I need to design the database as well

fn to_do() {
    // below are the sub functions the comprises the to_do function
    // a. write down the tasks
    // b. display the tasks
    // c. mark down the tasks 'done'
    //
    // below are screen, use image of to_do function
    // 
    // --writing down tasks
    // strk write 'task_0'
    //
    // --displaying the tasks
    // strk show tasks
    //
    // ==outputs==
    // |Your Tasks|
    //  |- task_0
    //  |- task_1
    //  |- task_2
    //
    // --marking down tasks
    // strk done 'task_0'  
    //
    // [marking down by task number]
    // strk done --task 1

}

rep_0:
had some ideas on data structure of the product.
But, when can I say "I'm done designing the data structure"?
Search for example process of data structure design

rep_1:
searching for general process to design a data structure

rep_2:
the I've looked into several web pages and documents and all I find after
defining the problem, or the purpose, comes choosing design structure
since I've use up 25 x 3 minutes on finding the process to design a
data structure, I will go on to next for now. I'll come back later
next is: set objective for iteration_1

rep_3:
wondering how to organize the objective of iteration_1 (or maybe iterations)
let's go back to Agile Samurai if I can find any hints for it

rep_0_plan: what's the objective, or the goal of iteration 1?

[master story list]
quote from Agile Samurai:
"The master story list is a collection of user stories (features) your customer
is going to want to see in their software"

first, I don't have this, "Master Story List"
I have big ideas, but haven't broken down to list of "features"

some key words found in "Agile Samurai"
- Define Your Release
  a release is a logical grouping of stories that make sense to your customer
  --something worth bunding up and deploying. It's also sometimes referred to as
  [mininal feature set (or MMF)]

am already in rep_1, but this is the plan
create a [master story list] and define what my MMF will be for iteration_0
